Hi, I'm Kel, and I want to talk to you about utopia.

But first, we need to talk about consent.

## Consent

Consenting to something means agreeing to it. It's something you _want_ to do.

Let's try a thought experiment: Imagine someone put a plate of your most disliked food in front of you and told you to eat it.

If you say silent, are you agreeing to eat? Of course not! **The default of consent is _no_.**.

Now, try to imagine what happens next. Do they threaten you to get you to eat the food? That might happen if this is your parents trying to get you to eat vegetables. Escalating threats until at some point you finally agree to eat your disliked food. Would you be angry? Frustrated? Agreeing when threatened is _coercion_, not consent.

Now imagine instead what if they offered you money? A hundred dollars (Or however much it would take for you to eat your most disliked food) incentive to eat the food. If you agree then, how would you feel?

When you make a decision free of coercion, when you consent to it, it has a very different feeling. You take on responsibility for that action, you get it done because it's something you want to do.

## Responsibility

My most disliked food is sauerkraut. I don't even like the smell of the stuff. If you put a plate of it in front of me, you _already_ are doing something to me without my consent. But you're planning to offer me a million dollars to eat it! Surely I'd agree, right? But what if I'm allergic?

You are responsible for your own actions. You are responsible for your mistakes. I'm not here for your excuses. I owe you nothing. Your intent _does not matter_ if you cause me harm.

You'll notice the tone shifts here. Anger is the typical response when someone hurts you without your consent. I like this example because it highlights both the problem and the solution.

The problem: We're going to mess up. At some point we'll guess wrong, and accidentally cause someone harm. The only person who can tell you the extent of that harm and how much you are responsible for is the person who was harmed. And yet, taking on responsibility for that harm could bankrupt you, causing _you_ harm. The situation becomes quickly impossible.

But I said this example includes a solution, didn't I?

In the above example, you could have sent me a letter explaining your deal. And I could have replied "I would love to accept, but eating that would kill me", and we would have moved on. While we can't achieve _perfect_ consent and responsibility, we can get _close_.

## The Impossible Utopia

Utopia is where nothing happens to you without your consent. That doesn't mean you're in control of everything, or that everything is predictable, it just means that you have _consented_ to the situation.

This is impossible. The universe itself will fight you. But we can try anyway.
