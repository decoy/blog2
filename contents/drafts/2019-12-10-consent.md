[^definition]: From the first sentence of the [Wikipedia entry on consent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent).

"Consent" is my favorite topic. It's something we as a society do every day, and most of us have a pretty good idea of what it means, but how often do you think about the concept directly? How well do we really know what it means to consent to something?

## Consent

Like any word, "consent" will have subtly different meanings for different people. So, for the purposes of this post, I want to clarify a few points [^usemorewords] first.

[^usemorewords]: (Use More Words)[https://gettingappsdone.com/episodes/use-more-words/] was an episode topic of the Getting Apps Done podcast!

The above definition has an important keyword: "Voluntarily". Consent has to be voluntary or it's not consent, it's coercion. For example: If I threaten to harm you until you do something, even if you eventually agree, it's coercion.

Along similar lines: If I ask you to do something, and you ignore me, are you consenting? Of course not! The default to consent is "no".

Finally: What if you change your mind later? You agreed, but once you start doing it, something comes up and you say "no". Nope, not consent. Consent can be _withdrawn_ at any time. (I expect this is the part of my definition of consent that the most folks will disagree with. Don't worry, we'll come back to this.)

So, let's try some examples:

"Eat this broccoli." Consensual? Maybe. This statement _assumes_ you've already agreed to my authority. Did you?

"Eat this broccoli or I'll ground you." Sounds like coercion, doesn't it? Now I'm threatening you.

"Eat this broccoli and I'll pay you 100 dollars." Would you eat broccoli for 100 bucks? If you say yes, then it's consensual. But only if you say yes.

## Giving up control

There's a problem with how I've described consent so far: Imagine I paid you 100 dollars to eat broccoli and then you withdraw without eating it! Maybe you took a bite and decided it was awful. Maybe a family emergency came up. Maybe you just changed your mind. It doesn't matter! You withdrew consent and now I'm out 100 dollars.

What would it take for me to trust you to do what you said you would?

For many, that answer is coercion. "Do your job or you're fired!" "If you don't follow the contract, I'll sue!" I threaten your future to get you to do what I want. To many this is common sense. Even if you don't like it, "it's just the way things are".

Now, if you got here from the [previous post](/2019/12/09/decade/), you know I don't want to talk about the way the world is, but the way the world could be. I'm here to talk about utopia, and the first step to utopia is accepting that consent is _required_. No coercion, no assumptions, and not bound to past decisions.

So, back to the question: What would it take for me to trust you to do what you said you would, knowing I have no control over you?

## Consent to Responsibility

This isn't a new problem. A simple example: Loans. Banks require down payments for this very reason. If there is risk in trusting you, you pay for that risk up front.

This creates two competing pressures: You don't want to consent to that (because you don't know what might come up in the future), and I don't want to risk my investment (knowing you can back out at any point).

Perfect! It's now a negotiation. Or maybe it's not: Maybe you're a friend and I already trust you. Maybe there are plenty of other examples of you being responsible and it's worth the risk.

The idea of 'gambling' a down payment looks a lot like coercion, but that subtle difference, consenting to pay for your risk up front instead of being threatened later, is an important one. At no point are you tied to a decision a previous "you" decided.
